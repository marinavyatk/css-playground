# 🎨 CSS Playground

Welcome to my CSS sandbox!  
Here I play around, test, mess with, and experiment with different styling techniques. Sometimes it's pretty, sometimes it's weird — but always fun.

## 🧪 What’s here

- 💡 Animation ideas
- 🌈 Experiments with colors, shadows, and gradients
- 🎭 UI oddities that no one really asked for — but hey, why not?
